Goals
-----

- [x] Best Algorithm for distributing mines for gaming considering the readability "Zen of Python" and optimized 'Performance of Code'. ... to date... until something else happens...


Todos
-----

- [ ] Graphically optimize DC code (the drawing code). I know I(original author) left off at a point and didn't continue...
- [ ] More Options for game play modes, local leaderboard as per minesweeper standard game.
- [ ] Options/dialogs for users to customize the graphics(mod the game)(Ex: The PyEmbeddedImage's(originally png's) could be loaded as user png's, etc...)
